malloc: Afunction in C that dynamically allocates a specific number of bytes in memory. From heap memory.

    // int = 4 bytes
    // char = 1 byte
    // sizeof(char) : size of data type

    char *grades = malloc(number_of_entries * sizeof(char));

If address stored within grades is equal to NULL. Dangerous to dereference a null poiter it leads to a Segmentation Fault

Segmentation fault: occurs when a program access a memory location that it is not allowed to access or attempts to access a memory loaction in a way that is not allowed.
