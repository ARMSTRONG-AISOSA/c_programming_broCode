perror() is a standard library function in C (and other POSIX-compliant systems) used to print an error message to the standard error stream (stderr) based on the current value of the global variable errno.

In essence, perror() helps you understand why a system call or library function failed.

Syntax: 
    void perror(const char *s);

--> Run "perror.c"

In this example:

fopen() fails because the file doesn't exist.
It sets the global variable errno to indicate this "no such file or directory" error.
perror("Error opening file") then prints the provided prefix "Error opening file:", followed by the system's description of the error associated with the current value of errno.
