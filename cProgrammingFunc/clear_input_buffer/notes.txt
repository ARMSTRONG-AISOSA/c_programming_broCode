Sure! Here's a detailed explanation of the line:
code:
    while ((c = getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF);
psuedocode:
    while ((if c is not a newline)  && (c is not end of line));
    continue loop
This is useful when:
    --You entered invalid input (e.g., letters when scanf("%d") expected a number), and the rest of the input (like abcd\n) needs to be discarded.
    --You want to flush out the input buffer before accepting new input.




code:
    while ((c = getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF);

This is a loop used to clear the input buffer, often placed in a helper function like clearInputBuffer(). Letâ€™s break it down step by step.

getchar()
    --getchar() reads one character at a time from standard input (stdin).
    --Each time itâ€™s called, it returns the next character that the user typed (including things like letters, numbers, spaces, and the newline character \n).

(c = getchar())
    --This assigns the return value of getchar() to the variable c.
    --c is usually declared as an int to handle all possible character values plus the special value EOF (end-of-file).

!= '\n' && c != EOF
The loop continues as long as:
    --The character is not the newline character ('\n'), and
    --The character is not end-of-file (EOF), which can occur, for example, when input is redirected from a file.

Purpose of the whole line
This loop keeps reading and discarding characters until it finds a newline (\n) or EOF.
This is useful when:
    --You entered invalid input (e.g., letters when scanf("%d") expected a number), and the rest of the input (like abcd\n) needs to be discarded.
    --You want to flush out the input buffer before accepting new input.

ðŸ§  Summary
Part	        -* Meaning
getchar()	    -- Reads one char from input
c = getchar()	-- Stores char in c
!= '\n'	        -- Keeps reading until newline
!= EOF	        -- Stops if input ends unexpectedly
while (...) ;	-- Repeats until a full line is cleared
