To comile the C file via terminal 
-cd into the folder and run
gcc 'filename' in the commandline
    --> gcc HelloWorld.c

To name the file yourself --> gcc HelloWorld.c -o helloWorld

To define the file & type --> gcc HelloWorld.c -o helloWorld(.exe/.out)

To run compiled file --> helloWorld.exe-- (linux)./helloWorld.exe

C only allows one main() function; 
C expects the entry point to be: int main()
Aynting in our "main" function is read procedurally, i.e top to bottom.
main() is the real entry point, and it calls your two other "helper" functions.

if you want to keep them separate functions for practice:
You can make them "normal helper functions" and call them from main() like this. ex "main01" & "main02"

variable = Allocated space in memory to store a value|
    We refer to a variable’s nane to access the stored value.
    That variable now behaves as if it was the value it contains.
    But we need to declare what type of data we are storing.
    Step 1: Declaration(integer) = int x;
    Step 2: Initialisation = x = 123;

*===== data type =====*
int age = 123; //Integer
float gpa = 3.02; //Decimal point
char grade = 'c'; //single character 
    --> use single quote;

char name[] = "Benson";//Array of characters 
    --> double quotes --> you emulate a sting
    -NB: C is not object oriented and "strings" are technically objects so you have to use an array to store multiple chracters

% ==> Format specifier/placeholder
In C programming, format specifiers are used with functions like printf() and scanf() to specify the type of data that is being input or output. Here’s a list of common format specifiers in C:
%d or %i: Signed decimal integer
%f: Decimal floating-point
%c: Single character
%s: String (array of characters)
