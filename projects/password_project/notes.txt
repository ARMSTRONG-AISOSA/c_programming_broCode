Password input function that works on both Windows and Linux/Unix systems. Features:

1. Platform Detection:
   - Uses #ifdef _WIN32 to detect Windows
   - Different includes and constants for each platform

2. Cross-Platform getch():
   - Windows: Uses built-in getch() from conio.h
   - Linux/Unix: Implements custom getch() using termios.h

3. Fixed Issues in Original Code:
   - Initialized i = 0 (was uninitialized)
   - Added buffer overflow protection (prevents writing beyond array bounds)
   - Added fflush(stdout) to ensure immediate display
   - Proper null termination of the password string

4. Platform-Specific Constants:
// Windows
    #define ENTER 13    // Carriage return
    #define BCKSPC 8    // Backspace

// Linux/Unix
    #define ENTER 10    // Line feed
    #define BCKSPC 127  // DEL key

How It Works:
On Windows:
   - Uses conio.h library's getch() function
   - Reads characters without echoing to console

On Linux/Unix:
   - Creates custom getch() function
   - Uses termios.h to disable canonical mode and echo
   - Temporarily changes terminal settings, reads character, then restores settings


5. Password Strength Checker
code:
   int check_password_strength(const char* password)

Scoring System (0-6 points):
   +1 point: At least 8 characters
   +1 point: At least 12 characters
   +1 point: Contains uppercase letters (A-Z)
   +1 point: Contains lowercase letters (a-z)
   +1 point: Contains digits (0-9)
   +1 point: Contains special characters (!@#$%^&*, etc.)

Strength Categories:
  * 0-3 points: Weak password (shows warning)
  * 4-6 points: Acceptable password strength


6. Password Hashing Function
code:
   unsigned int simple_hash(const char* password)

  * Uses "djb2 hash algorithm" (fast and reasonably good distribution)
  * Returns a 32-bit hash value for secure storage
  * Important: This is for demonstration - use proper cryptographic hashing in production

7. unsigned int simple_hash(const char "*password")
C doesn't have a built-in string type like Python or JavaScript. Instead: Strings are handled as pointers to char arrays This is efficient — avoids copying whole strings unnecessarily It’s standard practice for string input parameters
  -- *password means "a pointer to a string that won’t be modified"
  -- It lets the function process the password character by character
  -- This is the standard and efficient way to handle strings in C

const char *password means:
password is a pointer to the first character of the string (e.g., 'p' in "pass123")
Inside the function, we can iterate over the string character by character, like this:
code:
   while ((c = *password++)) {
      // do something with c
   }

This is a compact way to:
  * Access the current character (*password)
  * Then advance the pointer to the next character (password++)
  * Stop when the null terminator \0 is reached (because *password becomes 0 / false)

password++: advance to the next character
while ((c = *password++)): a loop that continues looping until the end of the string.
   --The condition checks if c != 0 (i.e., not the null terminator \0).


8. Generate a Numeric Hash from a String
code:
   unsigned int simple_hash(const char *password) //*password: Cheack @ notes.txt - 7
   {
      unsigned int hash = 5381;
      int c; // Declares an integer c to store each character of the string, one at a time, as it loops through the string.

      while ((c = *password++)) //loop
      {
         hash = ((hash << 5) + hash) + c;
      }

      return hash;
   }

This function creates a simple numeric hash from a string — in this case, a password — which can be used to uniquely represent the original string (though not securely).

🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown
🔹 unsigned int hash = 5381;
   --Initializes the hash variable to 5381, a "magic" number commonly used in hashing algorithms.
   --This number isn't random — it’s used by Dan Bernstein's hash function (djb2) for good distribution.

🔹 int c;
   --Declares an integer c to store each character of the string, one at a time, as it loops through the string.

🔁 while ((c = *password++))
This is a compact C idiom. Here's what's happening:
   1. *password gets the current character in the string.
   2. c = *password stores that character in variable c.
   3. password++ advances the pointer to the next character.
   4. The condition checks if c != 0 (i.e., not the null terminator \0).
🔁 This continues looping until the end of the string.


🔹 Inside the loop: hash = ((hash << 5) + hash) + c;
This is the core hash calculation. It’s equivalent to:
code:
   hash = hash * 33 + c;

Here’s what’s going on:
   --hash << 5 is a bitwise left shift by 5 bits (i.e., multiply by 32)
   --((hash << 5) + hash) = 32 * hash + hash = 33 * hash
   --Then you add c, the current character

So the new hash becomes:
code:
   hash = 33 * hash + c

This formula:
   --Combines the current hash value and the new character into a new value
   --Ensures that order matters: "abc" will give a different hash than "bca"

📌 Why Multiply by 33?
   --It’s empirically found to be a good number for spreading bits across the hash space.
   --It provides a nice balance of speed and randomness.
   --djb2 (Dan Bernstein's hash) is widely used because of this.


🧪 Example
code:
   simple_hash("abc")

Loop steps:
   1. 'a' → hash = 33 * 5381 + 'a' = 177670
   2. 'b' → hash = 33 * 177670 + 'b' = 5863208
   3. 'c' → hash = 33 * 5863208 + 'c' = 193485963
   4. end of string → return 193485963

✅ Summary
Step -    What Happens
1	  |    Start with hash = 5381
2	  |    For each character in password, multiply hash by 33 and add the character
3	  |    Continue until end of string (\0)
4    |    Return the final hash
