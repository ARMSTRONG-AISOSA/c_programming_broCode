This is a file input function in C that reads binary data from a file.

code:
    fread(&usr, sizeof(struct user), 1, fp);

Breakdown:
    fread(destination, size_of_each_item, number_of_items, file_pointer);


* `&usr` â†’ Destination: The **memory address** where the data should be stored. In this case, it's the address of a `struct user` variable named `usr`.

* `sizeof(struct user)` â†’ **Size** of each item to read, in **bytes**. This tells `fread` how big each record is.

* `1` â†’ **Number of items** to read. This tells it to read **one full `struct user`.

* `fp` â†’ The **file pointer**, which should point to an open file (in this case, `Users.dat`) opened with read mode (`"r"` or `"rb"`).




ðŸ“¦ What it does:

This line **reads one record (struct user)** from the file into the memory location of `usr`.

If the file contains a list of users saved in binary format (e.g., via `fwrite(&user, sizeof(struct user), 1, fp)`), then this reads one of those user records. And in a while loop it reads its one after another.

âœ… Return Value:
code:
    size_t result = fread(...);

* It returns the **number of items successfully read**.
* So if it returns `1`, it means **one full user record was successfully read**.

* If it returns `0`, it could mean:
  * **End of file** reached
  * **Error** reading the file

You can check for EOF or errors like so:

code:
    if (fread(...) != 1) {
        if (feof(fp)) {
            // End of file
        } else {
            // Some read error occurred
        }
    }

ðŸ§  Example Analogy:

Imagine `Users.dat` is a box filled with index cards (each representing a user).
`fread(&usr, sizeof(struct user), 1, fp);` means:

> "Take **1 whole card** (user data) from the box and copy all its info into my `usr` variable."

Let me know if you'd like a visual memory layout example or how to loop through multiple records.
