Showing different styles of ASCII progress bars in C. The code demonstrates:

Key Features:
1. Basic Progress Bar - Uses filled blocks (█) and spaces
2. Dot Style - Uses filled (●) and empty (○) circles
3. Equals Style - Classic [====>-----] format with arrow
4. Shaded Progress - Uses partial block characters for smoother animation
5. Multi-task Simulation - Shows how to use progress bars for different operations

Important Technical Details:

\r (carriage return) - Moves cursor to beginning of line to overwrite
fflush(stdout) - Forces immediate display (overcomes buffering)
usleep() - Creates delays for animation effect
Percentage calculation - percent / 5 gives us 20-character bars (100% ÷ 5 = 20)

Different Character Options:

Blocks: █, ▌, ▍, ▎, ▏ (different fill levels)
Simple: =, -, >, #, *
Dots: ●, ○, •, ∘
Shading: ░, ▒, ▓, █
