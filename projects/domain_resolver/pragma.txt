The #pragma keyword in C and C++ is a compiler-specific directive used to give special instructions to the compiler. It is part of the preprocessor directives (like #include, #define, etc.), but unlike those, #pragma is used to enable or disable certain features or behaviors in a way that‚Äôs often unique to a specific compiler.

üîç General Syntax
code:
    #pragma directive-name [optional-parameters]

‚úÖ Example Use Cases
1. Library Linking in Windows (used in your code)
code:
    #pragma comment(lib, "ws2_32.lib")
   -Tells the MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++) compiler to automatically link the ws2_32.lib Winsock library.
   -This is helpful to avoid manually adding the .lib file in project settings or command line.

2. Once-Only Header Inclusion
code:
    #pragma once
  -Prevents multiple inclusions of the same header file.
  -Alternative to #ifndef / #define / #endif guards.

3. Warning Control
code:
    #pragma warning(disable : 4996)
  -Used in Visual Studio to suppress specific compiler warnings (e.g., unsafe function warnings like strcpy()).

4. Packing Structures
code:
    #pragma pack(push, 1)
    struct MyStruct {
    char a;
    int b;
    };
    #pragma pack(pop)
  -Controls memory alignment and padding in structs (1-byte alignment in this case).
  -Useful for network programming or hardware interfacing.

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
    * Not portable: Different compilers support different #pragma directives.
    * Safe to ignore: Unknown pragmas are typically ignored by compilers (per the C standard), but can lead to warnings.

Common compilers like GCC, Clang, and MSVC all support their own #pragma options.

üß† Summary
Feature	Description
#pragma comment(lib, ...)  - Link a library (Windows/MSVC-specific)
#pragma once	           - Include guard to prevent double-inclusion
#pragma warning	           - Enable/disable warnings
#pragma pack	           - Control structure padding/alignment
