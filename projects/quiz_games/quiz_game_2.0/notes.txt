code:
    quizzes[count].question[strcspn(quizzes[count].question, "\n")] = '\0';


🚀 Purpose:
This line removes the trailing newline character (\n) from the question string that was read using fgets().

🔍 Breakdown:
quizzes[count].question
→ This is the current question string inside the quizzes array of structs.

strcspn(quizzes[count].question, "\n")
→ This finds the index of the first occurrence of \n (newline character) in the string.

strcspn() stands for "string complement span".

It returns the number of characters before any of the characters in the second argument ("\n" in this case) appear.

quizzes[count].question[...] = '\0'
    // Remove one from the last character(newline) from the string and resplace with a null terminator = '\0
→ Once the position of \n is found, it replaces it with '\0', which is the null terminator that ends a C string.
