*==== Compile C ====*
To comile the C file via terminal 
-cd into the folder and run
gcc 'filename' in the commandline
    --> gcc HelloWorld.c

To name the file yourself --> gcc HelloWorld.c -o helloWorld

To define the file & type --> gcc HelloWorld.c -o helloWorld(.exe/.out)

To run compiled file --> helloWorld.exe-- (linux)./helloWorld.exe

To run c in the terminal of vscode instead of the output, install "code runner", search for in settings and tick good to "run in terminal"
This is done because output doesn't accept user input.



*==== Math Functions in linux ====*
On Linux systems, mathematical functions like sqrt() are stored in a separate library called libm (the math library). Unlike some other operating systems, Linux doesn't automatically link this library when you compile programs.

When you call gcc without the -lm flag on any Linux system, the compiler can compile your code, but the linker can't find the implementation for sqrt() and similar math functions.

#Solution 1

The solution is the same regardless of which Linux distribution you're using - you need to explicitly tell the linker to include the math library by adding -lm to your compile command:
    Code:
    bashgcc test.c -o test -lm

#Solution 2
To implement the -lm flag in Code Runner (assuming you're using Visual Studio Code with the Code Runner extension), you need to modify the extension's settings. 

    -Open VS Code
    -Go to File > Preferences > Settings (or press Ctrl+,)
    -Search for "code-runner.executorMap"
    -Click on "Edit in settings.json"
    -Find the entry for "c" in the executorMap and modify it to include the "-lm" flag

Here's what the modification should look like:
    code:
    json"code-runner.executorMap": {
        "c": "cd $dir && gcc $fileName -o $fileNameWithoutExt -lm && $dir$fileNameWithoutExt"
    }

If you have other languages configured, make sure to keep those configurations and only modify the "c" entry.
After saving these changes, Code Runner will automatically include the -lm flag when compiling and running your C programs that use math functions.
This change will affect all C programs you run with Code Runner, which is generally what you want since it's harmless to include the math library even when you're not using it.
