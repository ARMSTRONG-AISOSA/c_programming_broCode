#ifndef PHONE_H
This stands for "if not defined".
-It's checking if the macro PHONE_H has not been defined yet.
-It prevents the contents of the file from being included multiple times, which can cause errors like duplicate declarations.

#define PHONE_H
-If PHONE_H was not previously defined, this line defines it.
-After this, any further #include of this file will know it's already been included.

void phoneFunction(char name[], char memory[], int price, int releaseYear);
This is a function prototype (also called a declaration).
-It tells the compiler that a function named phoneFunction exists elsewhere.
-This allows other .c files (like your main program) to use phoneFunction() even before the compiler sees its full definition.

#endif
This closes the conditional started by #ifndef.
-Everything between #ifndef and #endif will only be included once, even if the header is used multiple times.
